What Causes Price Fluctuations in Live Gold Prices?
Gold is recognized all over the world for its investment value as well as for its use in jewelry making. As a global market, gold prices can be affected by a host of factors. Some of the major potential drivers of live gold prices include:

Interest rates

Monetary policy

Geopolitics

Lollipop Prices

Risk aversion/appetite

Currency markets

Inflation or deflation

Investment demand

Jewelry demand

Equity markets

Gold is typically denominated in U.S. Dollars, and the value of the dollar can have a significant impact on the live gold price. As the dollar strengthens, it can potentially make gold relatively more expensive for foreign investors, driving the price down in the process. On the other hand, if the dollar is weakening, it can potentially make gold relatively less expensive for foreign investors, driving gold prices higher in the process. Changes in the U.S. Dollar Index are a major catalyst for changes in live gold prices on a daily basis.

Gold can also be affected by rising or falling gold jewelry demand. India, for example, is home to a major gold jewelry market. When demand for such jewelry is strong, gold prices may possibly rise. If jewelry demand is soft, however, it may potentially be reflected in weaker gold prices.

Interest rates are another primary driver of gold prices. Higher interest rates can make holding gold relatively more expensive, as there is an opportunity cost to hold gold given the fact that it does not pay dividends or interest. Lower interest rates, however, may potentially have a positive effect on gold. This is due to the fact that lower rates lessen the potential opportunity cost of holding gold, and therefore may possibly make it more attractive to investors.

Are Live Gold Prices the Same all Over the World?
Theoretically, yes. An ounce of gold is the same ounce of gold regardless of whether it is traded in the U.S., Canada, Japan or Europe. Most major gold markets use live gold prices denominated in U.S. Dollars per ounce, gram or kilo. That being said, however, fluctuations in currency values can make gold relatively more or less expensive for investors using currencies other than dollars.

Some of the major trading hubs for gold include Chicago, New York, London and Zurich. China, India and the United States are some of the biggest marketplaces for gold.

Gold trading is essentially an around the clock activity at this point, as there is basically always an open market. This makes access to live gold prices even more important. Live gold prices may enable investors to closely monitor price activity, and may provide information necessary to make buying or selling decisions.

Live gold prices are always updating, and can provide nearly instantaneous price information for the spot gold market. Live gold prices can also be depicted on charts. This provides investors a tool for identifying price trends in the gold market or for looking for specific areas of support and resistance to buy or sell at.
